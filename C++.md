## Reference variables in C++ [^1]
### What are variables in C++?
Variables are named memory locations that hold values of a specific type in a C++ program. In order to use variables in our program, we need to declare them first.

Here's an example:
```
int my_variable;
```
This declares a variable named my_variable of type int.

We can also initialize the variable with a value:

```
int my_variable = 42;
```
#### What is a reference in C++?
A reference is an alias for an existing variable. It allows us to refer to the variable by a different name. When we use a reference, we're not creating a new variable â€“ we're simply creating a new name for an existing variable.

Here's an example:
```
int my_variable = 42;
int& my_reference = my_variable;
```
This creates a reference named my_reference that refers to the variable my_variable. Now, we can use my_reference in place of my_variable:
```
my_reference = 69;
std::cout << my_variable << std::endl; // Output: 69
```
Note that when we assign a value to my_reference, we're actually changing the value of my_variable, because they refer to the same memory location.

#### How to declare a reference in C++?
We declare a reference by using the & symbol after the variable type:
```
int my_variable = 42;
int& my_reference = my_variable;
```
Here, my_reference is declared as a reference to an integer (int&).

### When to use references in C++?
References are useful when we want to pass variables to functions or methods without copying them. This can be more efficient than passing variables by value, especially for large data types like arrays or objects.

For example:
```
void increment(int& n) {
    n++;
}

int main() {
    int my_variable = 42;
    increment(my_variable);
    std::cout << my_variable << std::endl; // Output: 43
    return 0;
}
```
Here, we're passing my_variable to the increment() function by reference. When we modify the value of n inside the function, we're actually modifying the value of my_variable.

### How to use references with pointers in C++?
Pointers and references are related in C++. We can use the dereference operator (*) with a pointer to access the value it points to, and we can use the address-of operator (&) with a reference to get the memory address of the variable it refers to.

For example:

```
int my_variable = 42;
int* my_pointer = &my_variable; // Pointer to my_variable
int& my_reference = *my_pointer; // Reference to the value pointed to by my_pointer

my_reference = 69;
std::cout << my_variable << std::endl; // Output: 69
std::cout << *my_pointer << std::endl; // Output: 69
```
Here, we're creating a pointer named my_pointer that points to my_variable. We're then creating a reference named my_reference that refers to the value pointed to by my_pointer. When we modify the value of my_reference, we're actually modifying the value of my_variable.

### What are const references in C++?
A const reference is a reference that can't be used to modify the value it refers to. It's useful for passing variables to functions without allowing the function to modify them.

For example:

```
void print(const int& n) {
    std::cout << n << std::endl;
```
